UI Tools
A small project showcasing UI items such as panel, progress bar and mask. Having interface for rendering items via submitting through a container widget in OpenGl and Direct3D.

Note: This project is mainly for demontstration. To use this you will need the whole 3D engine which I kept private following certain restrictions from other contributors.

You are more than welcome to read the full demonstration and guide here on my website:
